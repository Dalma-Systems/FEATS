Fiware-Enabled Autonomous Transport System (FEATS) is a project whose scope is automated material transport within a production facility using an Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR).
This repository contains the source code for the CoFFEE and FI-BREW components of the FEATS project, as well as an executable of the LATTE component, for test / usage demonstration purposes.
The FEATS project is composed of these 3 components, and as such each of these has its own repository. Those repositories are included here in the form of Git submodules.

This project is part of [DIH<sup>2</sup>](http://www.dih-squared.eu/). For more information check the RAMP Catalogue entry for the
