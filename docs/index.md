# FEATS - FIWARE-Enabled Autonomous Transport System

This is the RTD page for FEATS, -- FIWARE-Enabled Autonomous Transport System -- a project within the scope of the [DIH2](http://www.dih-squared.eu/) programme.

## Description

FIWARE-Enabled Autonomous Transport System (FEATS) is a project whose scope is automated material transport within a production facility using an Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR). From the manufacturing companyâ€™s point of view, FEATS is a smart robotics-based intralogistics service where they need to provide some inputs to get an autonomous material delivery from point A to point B. This smart robotics-based intralogistics service comprises all FIWARE ready components developed within the scope of the DIH2 program, namely: CoFFEE (communicates with ERP system), FIROS (communicates with the AMR), FI-BREW (communicates with automatic warehouse) and LATTE (smart agent that manages and controls all actions).
